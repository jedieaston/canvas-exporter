# canvas-exporter
Exports the files from your favorite Canvas courses. It's pretty epic.


# How to use?

From your shell, git clone this repo, then run:

  `pip install canvasapi`
  
Then, add your Canvas URL (the url that you access Canvas at, like https://webcourses.ucf.edu if you are a cool knight like me), and your API
key (available in your profile settings in Canvas). 

All you have to do is run python3 main.py, and it works! Yay! You won't forget what you learned.
